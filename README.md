The website is built using three programming languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Java Script takes the main stage as this website is heavily scripted in JavaScript. It is the language that makes the website interactive and allows users to do things like stream and listen songs from a particular timeline. 

Cloud storage by hosting is used to stream the music online that users choose to listen, so they don't have to choose them again every time they visit the website. HTML is used to create the basic structure of the website, and CSS is used to make it look nice.
